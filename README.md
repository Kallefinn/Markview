# Markview

## Simple Markdown Viewer

Just a one trick pony.
It displays rendered markdown files nothing more.
My use case is reading documentation and readme's in properly rendered markdown while coding in Vim.
Application will remember layout if run with admin priviliges (maybe os dependent)

To do's
-   Start new instance if the clicked link has no standard program (espacially markdown files)
-   Improve scroll speed
-   preview of links?


### Third Level Heading

Some *italic* and **bold** text and `inline code`.

An empty line starts a new paragraph.

Use two spaces at the end  
to force a line break.

A horizontal ruler follows:

---

Add links inline like [this link to the Qt homepage](https://www.qt.io),
or with a reference like [this other link to the Qt homepage][1].

    Add code blocks with
    four spaces at the front.

> A blockquote
> starts with >
>
> and has the same paragraph rules as normal text.
