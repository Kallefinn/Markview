# Markview

## Simple Markdown Viewer

Just a one trick pony.
It displays rendered markdown files nothing more.
My use case is reading documentation and readme's in properly rendered markdown while coding in Vim.
the application will remember the layout if run with admin priviliges (maybe os dependent, only tested on Ubuntu 22.04)

To do's
-   Start new instance if the clicked link has no standard program (especially markdown files)
-   Improve scroll speed
-   preview of links
