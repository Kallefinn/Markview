# Markview

## Simple Markdown Viewer

Just a one trick pony.
It displays rendered markdown files nothing more.
My use case is reading documentation and readme's in properly rendered markdown while coding in Vim.
Application will remember layout if run with admin priviliges (maybe os dependent)

To do's
-   Start new instance if the clicked link has no standard program (espacially markdown files)
-   Improve scroll speed
-   preview of links?
